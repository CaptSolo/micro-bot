== Tweet limits ==

On joining a channel the bot starts processes for monitoring microblogging services
for keywords given in the configuration file.

On joining a channel a monitoring service will report:
 * new messages since the last time the program was run
 * but no more than max_tweets messages (defaut: 5)

The IDs of last messages retrieved are preserved between runs of the program, 
stored in IrcBot.mem file. 

The behaviour of what and how many messages are reported can be changed 
by modifying the MicroBlogSearch.py file.
