Things added to the deployed version of IrcBot

 - tweet/ident id to start with can be specified
 ---> ideally, the bot would remember / persist the ID of last message read,
      and use that when reloaded or if errors prevented from checking mblogging
      services inbetween

 - check that last_id for twitter and identi.ca increases monotonically
   (and never decreases)

 - unescape &quot; in twitter messages
 ---> same with all messages? (incl. identica?)
      - depends if they are already escaped or not

---

New ideas:

 - add errbacks for HTTP retrieval

 - add exception handling for errors in 3rd party code (e.g., in RDF parsing)
   ---> check if there are errors with the content received (e.g., HTML returned instead of RDF/XML)

 - check if the tweet is successfully sent, only then update the ID of last message
   processed
